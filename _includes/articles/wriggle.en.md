## Goals and Objectives

1. E-commerce
1. In-app payment
1. Geolocation
1. Marketplace
1. Table Reservations
1. Coupon Timer

## Solution

The startup management wanted to reach the maximum audience and launch the project in a short period of time. For this purpose, a solution for iOS and Android and web was chosen.

### Challenges

The first version of the app had to be launched just a month after the development started.

To do this, we had to involve more developers, which resulted in a heavy workload for the manager. Daily communication with the customer helped fine-tune the development process.

### Further Development

In 2014 the project was implemented in Bristol, the success of the application also led to the positioning of Wriggle in two more UK cities.
